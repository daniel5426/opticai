# Electron-Vite-React Project Overview

This project is an Electron desktop application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. The project includes SQLite database integration for data persistence and uses shadcn/ui for UI components.An all-in-one management system for optical clinics and stores, handling patient records, medical and optical exams, orders, billing, and inventory.
Streamlines clinic operations from eye exams to lens and frame orders, ensuring efficient and accurate patient care.

## UI Components

The application uses [shadcn/ui](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com) for UI components, which provides:
- Beautifully designed components
- Accessibility-focused design
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Customizable and reusable components
- Its an app in hebrew, so ui need to be rtl
- each new page created should be added a button in the appsidebar to go to it
- ALWAYS in every page or component use: style={{scrollbarWidth: 'none'}}
  to hide the vizible scrollbar without removing the functionality of scrolling

## Routing System

The application uses [TanStack Router](mdc:https:/tanstack.com/router) for client-side routing:
- Memory-based router optimized for Electron applications
- Declarative route definitions in `src/routes/routes.tsx`
- Root layout with outlet pattern in `src/routes/__root.tsx` 
- Navigation through `Link` components:
  ```tsx
  <Link to="/path">Link Text</Link>
  ```
- Clean, type-safe routing with automatic type generation
- Route parameters and nested routes support
