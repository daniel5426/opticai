Never use * → always select only needed columns.

Always paginate (limit, range) → never fetch whole tables.

Filter first → push filtering/sorting to the DB, don’t fetch everything and filter client-side.

Cache responses in the frontend when possible (avoid repeat identical queries).

Disable realtime unless you absolutely need live updates.

Use storage for files/blobs (images, docs) — don’t put them in Postgres.

Batch writes → avoid many small writes/reads in loops, send bulk queries.
